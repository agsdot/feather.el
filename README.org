- [[What is it?]]

* What is it?
~feather.el~ is completely new Emacs package manager
with parallel processing.

It provides a front end for [[https://github.com/conao3/leaf.el][leaf.el]],
and you can seamlessly manage Emacs packages.

It works from Emacs 22 and you can eliminate worry of
reinstallation by getting a strong partner called [[https://github.com/conao3/leaf.el][leaf.el]].
